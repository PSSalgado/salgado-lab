## The Salgado Lab is online

Welcome to the Salgado Lab website. It has taken some time, but we finally have our own online home - [salgadolab.org](https://salgadolab.org)!

Here you will find out more about our team and our research into the molecular mechanisms of *C. difficile* pathogenecity. If you're interested in sporulation mechanisms and the structure of the S-layer, here you can learn more about our work in these areas.

We'll also share the latest lab news and publications, as well as opportunities to join us.

We are passionate about our research but also about communicating it with a wider audience. From cross-stitching to performing arts and sci-fi comics, we're involved in a range of activities and will feature them here as well.

We hope you enjoy the website!
