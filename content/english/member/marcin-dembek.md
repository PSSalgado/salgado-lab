### About Me
 
Marcin joined the Salgado Lab as a postdoctoral researcher in 2014 after receiving a PhD in Molecular and Cellular Basis of Infection from Imperial College London. His work in Newcastle involved characterising *C. difficile* cell wall remodelling enzymes and their role in sporulation using a combination of molecular biology, microscopy and biochemistry. 
He has since moved into biopharmaceutical R&D and currently holds a Senior Scientist position at AstraZeneca UK.
