### About Me

Paola has recently finished her PhD in the Salgado Lab. Her work involved the structural characterisation of the *C. difficile* S-layer using X-ray crystallography and characterisation of SlpA's interactions to form the mature S-layer.

Her background is in Biophysics with a focus on Structural Biology.
She is currently a postdoctoral research with the Newcastle Drug Discovery Unit.
