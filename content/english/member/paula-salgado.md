### About Me

I am a structural biologist and biochemist interested in proteins associated with pathogenicity and disease. After a PhD at STRUBI, Oxford, and postdoctoral experience at Birkbeck and Imperial College London, I established and lead the *C. difficile* Structural Microbiology group at Newcastle University. 

My expertise has revealed the molecular details of key biological and pathogenicity processes and contributed to the development of innovative methods in protein crystallography, particularly in exploring new phasing tools. 

Combining detailed structural and functional characterisation of proteins, my research focuses on *C. difficile* spores and surface proteins, and their role in infection.
