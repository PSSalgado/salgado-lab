Many bacteria and archaea possess a two-dimensional protein array, the S-layer, that covers the cell surface and plays crucial roles in cell physiology. In *C. difficile*, the S-layer has been implicated in colonisation and inflammation.

We have recently determined the structure and assembly of SlpA, the main S-layer component in *C. difficile*, which is post-translationally cleaved into two S-layer proteins (SLPs): the high molecular weight, SLPH, and low molecular weight, SLPL. These subunits then form a complex (H/L) that is incorporated in the S-layer. The crystal structure of H/L complex mimics the organisation of the S-layer in the cells, providing a model for S-layer assembly in *C. difficile*.

We aim to continue to use a combination of structural, biochemical, biophysical and computational methods to further understand the role and dynamics of the S-layer.
